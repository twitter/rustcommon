# rustcommon-buffer

Bi-directional buffer

## Overview

This crate provides a simple bi-directional buffer which is particularly useful
for socket communications.

It acts as both a `BufReader` and `BufWriter`, helping to reduce system call
overhead by accumulating writes and buffering read results.

## Getting Started

### Building

rustcommon is built with the standard Rust toolchain which can be installed and
managed via [rustup](https://rustup.rs) or by following the directions on the
Rust [website](https://www.rust-lang.org/).
