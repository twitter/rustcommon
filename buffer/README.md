# rustcommon-buffer

Bi-directional buffer

## Overview

This crate provides a simple bi-directional buffer which is particularly useful
for socket communications.

It provides an interface that allows reading from and writing to a type that
implements Read and Write. It buffers bytes that have been read, enabling access
to partial reads without calling `peek()`. This is useful for when receive
traffic may need to be assembled from multiple frames. Writes are also buffered
before writing the contents out to a sink. This can make it easier to form
complex transmit traffic, such as serializing to Thrift.

## Getting Started

### Building

rustcommon is built with the standard Rust toolchain which can be installed and
managed via [rustup](https://rustup.rs) or by following the directions on the
