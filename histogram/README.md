# rustcommon-histogram

Histogram implementations inspired by HDRHistogram which can be used for both
single-threaded and multi-threaded applications.

## Overview

This crate provides a histogram implementation that is inspired by HDRHistogram.
It preserves precision across a range of values and can be useful for producing
percentile metrics for latency measurements or other readings. There are
implementations of both atomic and non-atomic histograms with similar function
signatures. The non-atomic forms should be preferred for single-threaded
use-cases.

## Getting Started

### Building

rustcommon is built with the standard Rust toolchain which can be installed and
managed via [rustup](https://rustup.rs) or by following the directions on the
Rust [website](https://www.rust-lang.org/).
